# Change: Define Clear Value Proposition (ONE SENTENCE)

## Linear Issue
**ID:** HOW-117
**Title:** [PR-001] Define Clear Value Proposition - ONE SENTENCE
**Priority:** 🔴 URGENT
**Effort:** 1-2 hours
**Link:** https://linear.app/howdycarter/issue/HOW-117

## Context

Camino needs a single, clear value proposition that:
- Drives all marketing messaging
- Appears on homepage, pricing, about, and all landing pages
- Differentiates us from competitors
- Resonates emotionally with target users
- Communicates the transformation promise

**This decision BLOCKS 9 other issues** including:
- HOW-111 (Homepage hero)
- HOW-112 (Features section)
- HOW-113 (Pricing page)
- HOW-114 (How It Works page)
- HOW-115 (Integrated Transformation landing page)
- HOW-121 (About page)
- HOW-127 (Lead capture form)
- HOW-129 (Meta tags/OG)
- HOW-120 (Launch announcement)

**Without a decided value prop, we cannot write any content.**

## Current State

**Existing homepage hero:** "Guided reflection for a meaningful life"
- Generic, not differentiated
- Doesn't explain HOW or WHAT makes it unique
- Doesn't communicate the 3-dimensional transformation
- No time commitment or promise

**Across the site:**
- Inconsistent messaging
- "Three Pillars" language (outdated - should be "Three Dimensions")
- No clear 12-week transformation narrative
- Generic "self-improvement" positioning

## Desired State

**ONE sentence** that:
- Clearly communicates the transformation (identity, worldview, relationships)
- States the time frame (12 weeks)
- Differentiates from competitors
- Creates emotional resonance
- Is memorable and repeatable
- Works across all channels (homepage, ads, social, email)

**Consistency:**
- Used verbatim in all hero sections
- Referenced in all meta descriptions
- Basis for all marketing copy
- Team-wide alignment

## Three Options to Choose From

### Option 1: Transformation Focus (Time-Bound)
**"Transform how you see yourself, the world, and your place in it—irreversibly—in 12 weeks."**

**Pros:**
- Time-bound promise (12 weeks = specific commitment)
- "Irreversibly" = strong transformation claim
- Three-dimension structure clear (self, world, place)
- Outcome-focused
- Creates urgency

**Cons:**
- Generic "transform" language (overused in industry)
- "Irreversibly" might scare some users
- Doesn't explain HOW (AI + coaching)
- No differentiation from other programs

**Best for:** Users seeking complete transformation with clear timeline

---

### Option 2: Integration Differentiator (Problem + Solution)
**"Most programs fix one thing. We integrate everything: identity, worldview, and relationships."**

**Pros:**
- Clear differentiation vs. competitors
- "Everything" communicates scope
- Problem + solution structure (most programs fail / we succeed)
- Three dimensions explicit (identity, worldview, relationships)
- Unique positioning (integration vs. single-focus)

**Cons:**
- Defensive positioning ("most programs fail")
- Less emotionally compelling
- No time frame mentioned
- No outcome promise

**Best for:** Users frustrated with single-focus programs

---

### Option 3: Grounded Generosity Outcome (Identity Transformation)
**"Become someone who's both deeply grounded AND naturally generous through dimensional transformation."**

**Pros:**
- Defines the END STATE (grounded generosity)
- "Become someone" = identity transformation (powerful)
- Unique positioning ("dimensional transformation")
- Aspirational + practical
- Emotional appeal (wholeness, balance)
- Differentiates with unique terminology

**Cons:**
- "Dimensional transformation" requires explanation
- No time frame
- Abstract concepts (grounded, generous)
- May not resonate with everyone

**Best for:** Users seeking inner peace + outward impact

---

## Recommendation: Option 3 with Modification

**Recommended Value Proposition:**

### "Become someone who's deeply grounded AND naturally generous—in 12 weeks."

**Why this works:**

1. **Identity transformation** ("Become someone") - Most powerful frame
2. **Clear outcome** (grounded + generous = wholeness)
3. **Time-bound** (12 weeks = specific commitment)
4. **Unique positioning** (no competitor promises THIS combination)
5. **Emotional resonance** (everyone wants peace + purpose)
6. **Memorable** (simple, rhythmic, quotable)
7. **Differentiates** (not generic "transformation")
8. **Avoids jargon** (removed "dimensional transformation")

**Usage across channels:**
- **Homepage hero:** "Become someone who's deeply grounded AND naturally generous—in 12 weeks."
- **Pricing page:** "Choose your path to becoming grounded and generous"
- **About page:** "We help people become grounded and generous through systematic transformation"
- **Meta description:** "Camino: Become grounded and generous in 12 weeks through AI-assisted coaching"
- **Social ads:** "Grounded peace + generous action. 12 weeks. Start today."

## Technical Approach

This is a **decision task**, not a code task.

### Files to Update (After Decision Made)

**Obsidian Documentation:**
- `{OBSIDIAN_VAULT}/01_PROJECTS/Camino/Themes.md`
  - Add decided value prop to "Core Narrative" section
  - Update "Primary Themes" to reference it
  - Add usage guidelines

**Linear Issues (9 issues to update):**
- HOW-111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 121, 127, 129, 120
  - Add comment: "Value prop decided: [final text]"
  - Update description to reference value prop where needed

**Project Documentation:**
- This OpenSpec proposal (document decision made)
- Linear issue comment (rationale + decision)

### Process

1. **Stakeholder meeting** (1 hour max)
   - Review all 3 options
   - Discuss pros/cons
   - Test each option:
     - Read aloud
     - Imagine on homepage
     - Check emotional response
     - Verify clarity ("grandma test")
   - Vote or consensus decision

2. **Document decision**
   - Linear issue comment with chosen option + rationale
   - Update Obsidian Themes.md
   - Update this OpenSpec proposal

3. **Cascade to blocked issues**
   - Update 9 blocked Linear issues with the decision
   - Unblock for implementation

## Task Breakdown

- [x] Create OpenSpec proposal with all 3 options
- [ ] Schedule stakeholder meeting
- [ ] Hold decision meeting (1 hour)
- [ ] Document decision in Linear HOW-117 comment
- [ ] Update Obsidian Themes.md with decided value prop
- [ ] Update 9 blocked Linear issues with decision
- [ ] Notify team of decided value prop
- [ ] Archive this OpenSpec change

## Testing Requirements

**N/A - This is a decision task, not a code implementation.**

However, we can "test" the chosen value prop:

- [ ] **Clarity test:** Can a 12-year-old understand it?
- [ ] **Emotional test:** Does it create desire/aspiration?
- [ ] **Differentiation test:** Does it clearly differ from competitors?
- [ ] **Memorability test:** Can someone repeat it after hearing once?
- [ ] **Channel test:** Does it work in hero, ads, social, email?
- [ ] **Truth test:** Can we deliver on this promise?

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] ONE sentence chosen from the 3 options (or modified version)
- [ ] Stakeholder consensus or majority vote
- [ ] Decision documented in Linear comment with full rationale
- [ ] Obsidian Themes.md updated with value prop + usage guidelines
- [ ] All 9 blocked Linear issues updated with decision
- [ ] Team notified via Slack/email (if applicable)
- [ ] This OpenSpec proposal archived to specs/ directory

## Dependencies

**Depends On:** None (can start immediately)

**Blocks (9 issues cannot start until this is complete):**
- HOW-111: [CM-001] Update Homepage Hero Section
- HOW-112: [CM-002] Rewrite Homepage Features Section
- HOW-113: [CM-003] Complete Pricing Page Overhaul
- HOW-114: [CM-004] Create How It Works Methodology Page
- HOW-115: [CM-005] Create Integrated Transformation Landing Page
- HOW-121: [CM-006] Create About Page with Founder Story
- HOW-127: [CM-012] Implement Lead Capture Form
- HOW-129: [SEO-003] Optimize Meta Tags & Open Graph
- HOW-120: [GTM-001] Create Launch Announcement Content

## Estimated Effort

**Total:** 1.75 hours

**Breakdown:**
- Stakeholder meeting: 1 hour
- Documentation (Linear, Obsidian): 30 minutes
- Updating blocked issues: 15 minutes

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk 1:** Meeting goes long, no decision reached
**Mitigation:** Time-box to 1 hour, force decision even if not "perfect." Can iterate later.

**Risk 2:** Stakeholders can't agree
**Mitigation:** Project owner (Howdy) makes final call if no consensus after discussion.

**Risk 3:** Chosen value prop doesn't resonate with users
**Mitigation:** This is a hypothesis. We'll A/B test different messaging after launch. Choose best option now, validate later.

**Risk 4:** Value prop too abstract or confusing
**Mitigation:** Run "grandma test" - if your grandmother wouldn't understand it, simplify further.

## Decision Criteria

Choose the value prop that scores HIGHEST on:

1. **Clarity** (1-10): Can anyone understand it instantly?
2. **Differentiation** (1-10): Does it clearly differ from competitors?
3. **Emotional Appeal** (1-10): Does it create desire?
4. **Truthfulness** (1-10): Can we deliver on this promise?
5. **Memorability** (1-10): Can users repeat it?
6. **Versatility** (1-10): Works across all channels?

**Scoring:**
- Option 1 (Time-Bound): Clarity 9, Diff 5, Emotion 7, Truth 8, Memory 7, Versatile 8 = **44/60**
- Option 2 (Integration): Clarity 8, Diff 9, Emotion 6, Truth 9, Memory 7, Versatile 7 = **46/60**
- Option 3 (Grounded Generosity): Clarity 7, Diff 10, Emotion 9, Truth 8, Memory 9, Versatile 8 = **51/60**
- **Recommended (Option 3 + time):** Clarity 9, Diff 10, Emotion 9, Truth 8, Memory 10, Versatile 9 = **55/60**

**Winner:** Recommended modification of Option 3

## Next Steps After Completion

1. Move this proposal to `openspec/specs/HOW-117-value-prop/`
2. Mark Linear HOW-117 as "Complete"
3. Begin work on HOW-119 [TEST-001] Testing Infrastructure (next blocker)
4. Begin work on HOW-111 [CM-001] Homepage Hero (now unblocked)

## Notes

- This is the MOST IMPORTANT decision for marketing consistency
- All content depends on this
- It's okay to iterate later, but we need ONE decision now
- Choose the one that feels truest to Camino's mission
- Focus on what users WANT to become, not what they're escaping
