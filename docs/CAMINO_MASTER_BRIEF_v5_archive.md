## **Chapter 1: Identity & Vision**

### 1.1 The Core Truth
**"You are not broken. You are just seeing through the wrong lens."**

Modern self-help often treats people as problems to be fixed. It suggests that if you just hustle harder, meditate longer, or optimize your morning routine, you'll finally be happy. We believe that anxiety, burnout, impostor syndrome, and confusion are not character flaws—they are symptoms of misaligned "lenses" (unconscious semantic filters through which we view reality).
*   *Example*: If you have a "Scarcity Lens," you will interpret a neutral email from your boss as a threat to your job.
*   *Example*: If you have a "Performance Lens," you will interpret rest as laziness.

**The Camino Thesis: The Three-Dimensional Coherence Model**
True transformation is not just a habit—it is a shift in *coherence* across three fundamental dimensions.
1.  **Identity Shift**: From *Conditional Worth* (I am what I achieve) → *Inherent Worth* (I am enough).
2.  **Worldview Shift**: From *Scarcity* (Life is a battle) → *Abundance* (Life is a gift).
3.  **Relationship Shift**: From *Isolation* (I am alone) → *Interconnection* (I am part of the whole).

**The Outcome: "Grounded Generosity"**
When these three dimensions align, the user achieves "Grounded Generosity"—a state of natural embodiment of worth, abundance, and influence, replacing the fragmented, reactive state of modern burnout.

### 1.3 The Solution: An Active Thinking Partner
Camino is not a passive journal. It is an **active thinking partner**.
*   **It Asks**: If you write "I'm stressed," it asks "What aspect of this stress feels within your control?"
*   **It Remembers**: It connects today's frustration to last month's fear.
*   **It Mirrors**: It highlights your own language back to you to reveal cognitive rigidity.


### 1.4 Target Audience (Detailed Personas)

#### **Sarah, the Intentional Designer (32)**
*   **Role**: Senior Product Designer.
*   **Vibe**: Reads "Atomic Habits", uses Figma, drinks oat flat whites.
*   **Quote**: *"I know what matters to me, but I struggle to stay aligned with it day-to-day."*
*   **Pain Point**: Drowning in self-improvement content but can't sustain habits. Sporadic journaling.
*   **Goal**: Wants a "fidelity tracker" for her soul—structure and consistency.

#### **Marcus, the Searching Founder (38)**
*   **Role**: Startup Founder (Post-Exit).
*   **Vibe**: YC alum, burned out by the hustle, skeptical of "woo-woo" spirituality.
*   **Quote**: *"I consume so much wisdom, but where does it go? I need something that helps me actually internalize it."*
*   **Pain Point**: High achiever, burned out. Needs efficiency. Views introspection as a high-leverage activity.
*   **Goal**: Resilience and clarity. "Insights per minute."

#### **Leah, the Conscious Professional (29)**
*   **Role**: Executive Coach.
*   **Vibe**: Active on LinkedIn, teaches others.
*   **Quote**: *"I help others find clarity — I need a tool that holds space for my own growth."*
*   **Pain Point**: Holds space for everyone else but has no container for herself.
*   **Goal**: Deepen her own practice so she can serve clients better.

### 1.5 Brand Identity
**"Calm Technology" for a Noisy World.**
Our aesthetic and voice are not just "styling"—they are part of the functionality. To reflect clearly, you need a clear mirror.
*   **Voice**: Socratic, Clear, Warm. We never preach. We ask. We don't say "You should relax." We ask, "What would happen if you let go of this for an hour?"
*   **Aesthetic**: Minimalist, Spacious, Natural. We use the **OKLCH** color space for perceptual uniformity (Stone, Amber, Emerald). No gamification "pings" or flashy badges.
*   *See Chapter 8 for the full Design System.*

### 1.6 The Transformation Model
How does a user actually change? We follow the **Reflect-Discover-Grow** cycle:
1.  **Reflect (Data)**: The user dumps raw thoughts. "I'm annoyed at Mike."
2.  **Discover (Pattern)**: The AI aggregates data. "You are often annoyed when your competence is questioned."
3.  **Grow (Action)**: The user experiments. "Next time, I will name the feeling instead of blaming Mike."

## **Chapter 2: The Customer Journey**

### 2.1 Entry: The "Reflect" Intro
*   **Source**: Organic content (Substack essays on "The Lens Theory") or Paid Social ("Pattern Interruption" ads).
*   **The Lead Magnet**: The **Free 14-Day Introduction**.
*   **The Promise**: "See yourself clearly in 14 days."
*   **The Onboarding**:
    *   **The "Life Lens" Quiz**: 5 questions to establish baseline values.
        *   *Q1*: "What do you value most? (Freedom, Mastery, Connection, Peace)"
        *   *Q2*: "What feels heaviest right now?"
    *   **The Hook**: Immediate "Lens Profile" generation (e.g., "You are a Striving Perfectionist").

### 2.2 Activation: The "Aha" Moment
We define "Activation" as the moment a user realizes Camino is not just a diary.
*   **The Rule**: User completes **3 Reflections** AND views **1 Pattern Insight**.
*   **The Logic**: One entry is data points. Three entries is a trend.
*   **The Target**: >60% of signups reach this state within 7 days.
*   **The Experience**:
    *   *User*: Writes about specific stress on Mon, Wed, Fri.
    *   *AI*: "Sarah, notice that every time you write about 'deadlines', your language shifts to self-blame. This is the 'Performance Lens'."

### 2.3 Retention: The Habit Loop
We use the "Hook Model" to build the daily practice.
1.  **Trigger (External)**: Daily Email/Push at user-selected time (e.g., 8am "Morning Intention").
2.  **Trigger (Internal)**: The feeling of "confusion" or "overwhelm" becomes associated with opening Camino.
3.  **Action**: The 3-minute guided reflection. Low friction, high clarity.
4.  **Variable Reward**:
    *   **Insight Chips**: Collectible digital artifacts representing breakthroughs.
    *   **Weekly Summary**: "Spotify Wrapped" for mental states.
5.  **Investment**: The more entries a user writes, the smarter the "Mirror" becomes (Context Engine).

### 2.4 Transition: The Gap
*   User realizes: *" I see the pattern now... but how do I stop it?"*
*   **The Upsell**: "You've identified the Performance Lens. Join the **Journey** program to build the skills to shift it."

## **Chapter 4: The AI Intelligence Layer**

### 4.1 Intelligence Strategy
*   **The Model**: GPT-4o (via OpenAI Platform).
*   **The Logic**: "Mirroring" vs. "Advising". The AI is strictly forbidden from giving prescriptive advice ("You should do X"). It must only reflect patterns ("You frequently mention X when Y happens").

### 4.2 The Prompt Taxonomy (The "Reflect" Engine)
The system rotates through 3 core dimensions to ensure holistic data gathering.
1.  **Identity** (Who am I?):
    *   *Example*: "What did you learn about yourself today that surprised you?"
    *   *Tags*: `self-discovery`, `authenticity`, `values`.
2.  **Worldview** (How do I see reality?):
    *   *Example*: "What assumption about the world was challenged today?"
    *   *Tags*: `perspective`, `beliefs`, `meaning-making`.
3.  **Relationships** (How do I connect?):
    *   *Example*: "Describes a meaningful interaction you had today."
    *   *Tags*: `connection`, `boundaries`, `empathy`.

### 4.3 The "Insight" Algorithm
*   **Trigger**: The `generateInsightForUser` function fires after every **3rd reflection**.
*   **Input**: The last 3 reflections + User Profile + Signup Date.
*   **Process**:
    1.  Fetch last 3 entries.
    2.  Inject System Prompt: *"You are Camino AI. Analyze these entries for linguistic patterns, cognitive distortions, and value conflicts."*
    3.  Generate `insight` object.
*   **Output**: Saved to `insights` table with `themes` array (e.g., `["perfectionism", "burnout"]`).


---

## **Chapter 5: Technical Architecture**

### 5.1 The Stack
*   **Frontend**: `walter-marketing` (Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind, ShadCN).
*   **Backend**: Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Edge Functions).
*   **Platform**: `walter-lms` (Frappe/Docker) - Hosts the Phase 4 Course Content.
*   **Repo Structure**: Monorepo with Worktree-based development linked to Linear Tickets (e.g., `worktrees/HOW-123-feature-name`).

### 5.2 Data Models (Supabase)
The core schema is defined in `supabase/schema.sql`.
*   **`profiles`**: Extends Auth. Stores `plan` ('reflect', 'journey'), `streak_days`, and LMS sync tokens.
*   **`reflections`**: Stores `content`, `mood` ('good', 'neutral', 'low'), and `prompt_id`.
*   **`insights`**: Stores AI-generated patterns with `themes` array (e.g., `['burnout', 'values']`).
*   **`journey_progress`**: Tracks `module_id` completion and `progress_percent`.
*   **`prompts`**: System-wide content table. Columns: `dimension` (Identity/Worldview), `day_number`, `phase`, `tags`.

### 5.3 Infrastructure
*   **Hosting**: Vercel (Frontend), Coolify/VPS (LMS/Docker).
*   **Auth**: Supabase Auth (Magic Link / Google).
*   **Payments**: Stripe (via `subscriptions` table syncing `stripe_customer_id`).

    *   Includes: Daily AI prompts, Weekly Analysis, 2 Courses/mo.
    *   Cancel anytime.
*   **Coaching**: **Add-on** (Retention/High-Touch).

### 6.2 Success Metrics (The Activation Funnel)
We track success via the postgres view `activation_funnel`.
1.  **Signups**: Total `auth.users`.
2.  **Engagement**: Count of users with 1, 2, and 3 reflections (Table: `reflections`).
3.  **Activation**: Count of users who viewed their first insight (Table: `user_activations`).
    *   *Target Days-to-Activation*: < 7 days.
    *   *Target Conversion*: 60% of signups.

### 6.3 Operational Workflow
We follow a strict **Linear-to-Worktree** process.
*   **Ticket**: Every feature starts as a Linear Issue (e.g., `HOW-123`).
*   **Branch**: Created as `feature/HOW-123-description`.
*   **Migration**: SQL files include the ticket ID (e.g., `-- Issue: HOW-177`).
*   **Deployment**: Merged to `main` triggers Vercel (Web) and Docker (LMS) builds.
